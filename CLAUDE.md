# Mana Archive — Claude Context

## Current version: v3.16.1

## Stack: FastAPI + Jinja2 + SQLite + K3s/ArgoCD

## Non-negotiable constraints

- InventoryRow is the single source of truth
- StorageLocation is the canonical location system (decks = type="deck")
- SQLite until v4 — do NOT suggest PostgreSQL changes
- No service layers unless already present
- Do NOT break existing routes or templates (live system)

## Current phase

Active user onboarding. Self-service registration in place — users sign up independently with email + display name.

## Architecture notes

### Drawer sorter

`DRAWER_SORTER_USERNAMES = frozenset({"jason@vanfreckle.com", "test"})` in `app/dependencies.py` gates the automatic 6-drawer card sorter (`resort_collection`). Only these users get drawer/slot auto-assignment on import and access to the Drawers page, Audit page, and "Apply Drawer Sorter" button.

All other users manage their own StorageLocations and pick placement manually.

To add a user to the auto-sorter, update `DRAWER_SORTER_USERNAMES` in `app/dependencies.py` (one place — it's injected as a Jinja2 global and imported into `main.py`).

### Import destination

All import paths (CSV, paste list, and manual) present a **Destination** dropdown at commit time. For drawer-sorter users the first option is "Auto-sort to drawers" (existing behaviour); any other selection places cards directly into that StorageLocation and skips pending entirely. For other users, a location must be chosen.

**Decks appear as destinations** in the dropdown (as a separate `<optgroup>`), using the deck's `storage_location_id` as the value. This lets users import directly into a deck without the placement step. `place_imported_rows()` in `inventory_service.py` handles bulk placement to any location, including deck locations.

The `decks` list (from `list_decks()`) is passed to all three preview templates: `import_preview.html`, `manual_preview.html`.

### Security (added v3.4.6)

- CSRF protection: session token via `CsrfRequired` dependency on all POST routes; `{{ csrf_token }}` hidden field in every form
- Open redirect prevention: `safe_redirect_url()` in `main.py` validates Referer before redirect
- ValueError handler: returns clean 400 instead of 500 stack trace
- Session secret: startup check refuses to boot in production without `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` env var

### Shared rendering

`render()`, `CsrfRequired`, `get_csrf_token()`, and `get_current_user()` all live in `app/dependencies.py`. Do not redefine them elsewhere.

### StorageLocation auto-creation

`_get_or_create_drawer_location()` in `inventory_service.py` bootstraps missing drawer StorageLocations on first confirm. Prevents 500s for users whose drawer rows don't exist yet.

### DeckItem removed (v3.5)

`DeckItem` model and `deck_items` table are gone. Deck cards have always been `InventoryRow` records with `storage_location_id` pointing to the deck's StorageLocation — DeckItem was dead code after the v3.4 migration. The drop is in `scripts/migrate_v3_5_drop_deck_items.py`.

### Commander role (v3.5)

`InventoryRow.role` (nullable String(32)) marks a card's role within a deck. Currently only value used is `"commander"`. Set via `POST /decks/rows/{row_id}/toggle-commander`. In `deck_detail.html`, cards with `role=="commander"` appear in a separate **Commander(s)** panel above the main deck grid. Added via `scripts/migrate_v3_5_inventory_role.py`.

### Migrations

Idempotent migration scripts live in `scripts/`. `scripts/run_migrations.py` is the runner — add new migrations there in order. Each migration is tracked by name in the `schema_migrations` SQLite table. `run_migrations()` is called from `on_startup()` in `main.py`, so every deploy automatically applies pending migrations before the app serves traffic.

## Telemetry query

kubectl exec -n mana-archive deploy/mana-archive -- \
python -c "from sqlalchemy import text; from app.db import engine; \
conn = engine.connect(); \
rows = conn.execute(text('''
SELECT u.username,
COUNT(DISTINCT ir.id) as inventory_rows,
COUNT(DISTINCT d.id) as decks
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN inventory_rows ir ON u.id = ir.user_id
LEFT JOIN decks d ON u.id = d.user_id
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY inventory_rows DESC
''')).fetchall(); \
print('\n'.join(str(r) for r in rows)); conn.close()"

### Import format support (v3.6)

Two import paths on `/import`:

**CSV upload** — `parse_scanner_csv()` auto-detects format from column headers:

- **Scanner App** (default): `scryfall_id / set_code / collector_number / finish / quantity`
- **Helvault** (free & pro): detected by `extras` column (→ `finish`). Resolved via Scryfall ID.
- **Moxfield** collection CSV: detected by `Edition` column. Maps `Edition → set_code`, `Foil → finish`, `Count → quantity`. Resolved via set+collector number.

**Paste card list** — `parse_text_list()` parses `N CardName (SET) Collector#` format:

- Accepts Moxfield deck exports, MTGA, MTGO, and any standard text list format.
- Lookup priority: set+collector → exact name+set → fuzzy name.
- `fetch_card_by_name()` in `scryfall.py` handles exact then fuzzy Scryfall `/cards/named` lookups.
- Section headers (Deck, Sideboard, Commander, etc.) are silently skipped.
- MTGA foil marker (`*F*`) is detected and mapped to finish=foil.

Both paths normalize to the same row dict and feed into `persist_import_rows()` via the shared preview → commit flow. `format_name` is shown on the preview page.

### UI/UX consistency (v3.7)

All templates use a consistent panel/section structure:

- Hero sections: `class="panel page-hero"` (large) or `class="panel hero-panel compact-hero"` (compact)
- Action/filter strips: `class="panel controls-panel"` (block layout; form inside uses `.filter-row` for flex)
- Content panels: `class="panel"` with `<h3 class="panel-title">` inside
- Tables: globally styled — no extra class needed, just bare `<table>`
- CSS utilities in `style.css`: `.controls-panel`, `.btn-danger-small`, `.finish-badge`, `.warning-text`

Templates updated in v3.7: `decks.html`, `import.html`, `import_preview.html`, `manual_preview.html`, `audit.html`, `sets.html`, `set_detail.html`, `pending.html`, `locations.html`, `drawers.html`, `card_detail.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `manual_search_results.html`, `import_result.html`.

### Admin and account (v3.7)

- `GET /admin` — admin-only page (gated by `User.is_admin`). Shows all users with card count, deck count, last activity. Actions: toggle active/inactive, toggle admin, reset password, create new user, delete user (cascade-deletes all their data).
- `GET /account` + `POST /account/change-password` — available to all authenticated users; password change requires current password verification.
- `require_admin` dependency in `app/dependencies.py` — raises 403 if `current_user.is_admin` is false.
- Admin/Account links appear in nav. Admin link is gated by `current_user.is_admin`.
- Migration `v3_7_admin_user` ensures `users.is_admin` column exists and seeds `jason.v` as admin.
- Delete user cascade order: TransactionLog → InventoryRow → ImportBatch → Deck → StorageLocation → User.

### Card attributes (v3.8)

- `Card` model gains `colors` (space-sep WUBRG, e.g. `"W U"`), `color_identity` (space-sep WUBRG, `""` = colorless — distinct from `colors` for cards with colored abilities/land types), `mana_cost` (e.g. `"{2}{W}"`), `cmc` (float). Migration `v3_8_card_attrs` adds colors/mana_cost/cmc; migration `v3_8_8_color_identity` adds color_identity. Refresh loop backfills cards with NULL `color_identity`.
- Extended search syntax everywhere: `c:WU`, `cmc:>3`, `mana:{W}`, on top of existing `t:`, `o:`, `s:`, `r:`, `finish:`.
- New sort options on collection and location detail: Type, Color (WUBRG order), Mana Cost.
- Location detail now has search + sort controls (previously unsorted, no search).
- Deck detail search upgraded from plain substring to full Scryfall-style syntax.
- Unified card display via `_macros.html` `inventory_card` macro — collection, location detail, deck detail all render from one place.
- Import resort is now a background daemon thread (non-blocking); explicit "Apply Drawer Sorter" stays synchronous.
- Pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` mirrors CI lint checks. New developers run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- Token tracking on set detail: "Show Tokens" toggle fetches `t{set_code}` token set; tokens tracked ownership-only (no USD price).

### Deck analytics (v3.8.4)

- `compute_deck_analytics(rows)` in `deck_service.py` — takes a list of unfiltered `InventoryRow` ORM objects and returns mana curve (bucketed 0–6+, lands excluded), card type breakdown (Creature → Planeswalker → Battle → Instant → Sorcery → Enchantment → Artifact → Land → Other), color pip counts (parsed from `mana_cost`), and average CMC.
- `compute_deck_tokens(rows)` in `deck_service.py` — returns deduplicated list of `{name, type_line, image_url, set_code, collector_number, scryfall_id}` dicts for tokens produceable by the deck. Calls `fetch_deck_tokens()` in `scryfall.py`: Pass 1 batch-fetches deck cards to collect token stubs from `all_parts` (component="token"); Pass 2 batch-fetches the token cards themselves for `image_uris` and set info. Cached per unique card set keyed on `(_DECK_TOKEN_CACHE_VERSION, frozenset)` — bump version when dict shape changes.
- `deck_detail_page` in `main.py` always runs a separate unfiltered query for analytics so the panel reflects the full deck even when the search filter is active. Analytics are `None` for empty decks.
- Analytics panel in `deck_detail.html` — 3-column layout: Mana Curve | Card Types | Color Pips. Avg CMC shown as a prominent stat. Collapses to 2-col when no pips, stacks on mobile. Vertical dividers between columns.
- Tokens panel in `deck_detail.html` — separate panel below the deck card grid. Responsive image grid (`token-image-grid`); clicking a token image opens `/tokens/{scryfall_id}` (internal detail page); clicking the name opens Scryfall in a new tab.
- `GET /tokens/{scryfall_id}` — token detail page using `token_detail.html`. Fetches token data via `fetch_card_by_scryfall_id` (cached). Shows large image, type line, oracle text, Scryfall link. No inventory section (tokens not owned).
- Remove-from-deck override fields (drawer/slot) collapsed into a `<details class="return-details">` — "Remove from Deck" summary expands to reveal override inputs + "Confirm Remove" submit. Only shown for drawer-sorter users on non-commander rows.
- CSS: `.analytics-grid`, `.analytics-section`, `.analytics-avg-cmc`, `.analytics-curve`, `.curve-col/.curve-bar/.curve-count/.curve-label`, `.analytics-row`, `.arow-label/.arow-bar-wrap/.arow-bar/.arow-count`, WUBRG gradient bars, `.token-image-grid/.token-card/.token-card-img/.token-card-placeholder/.token-card-name/.token-card-type`, `.return-details/.return-summary`.

### Brand assets and header layout (v3.8.3)

- `app/static/icons/` — actual brand PNGs at 15 sizes (16–1024px) using card-frame app icon design; wordmark PNGs at 256/512/1024px; `favicon.ico` built from 16/32/48px icons.
- `base.html` favicon chain: `favicon.ico` (legacy) → `icon-32x32.png` (PNG fallback) → `icon-180x180.png` (Apple touch icon).
- Header restructured to two-column flex layout: left column = wordmark + nav stacked; right column = version pill + logout stacked. This aligns logout with the nav row at the far right.
- Brand area uses `wordmark-1024.png` displayed at 44px height (`class="brand-wordmark"`) — no separate icon + text elements.
- CSS classes: `.header-left` (flex-column, space-between), `.brand-wordmark` (height 44px, auto width). Removed `.brand-row`, `.brand-icon`, `.brand-text`.
- `list_decks()` in `deck_service.py` now sums `InventoryRow.quantity` (total copies) for `card_count` instead of counting distinct rows.

### Location page deck management (v3.8.2)

- `POST /locations/create-deck` — creates a proper `Deck` record + linked `StorageLocation` from the Locations page; redirects back to `/locations`. Form has name + format dropdown (same options as Decks page).
- Orphaned deck locations (type="deck", no linked `Deck` record, no rows) now show a Delete button in the Locations table. `delete_location()` allows deletion when no `Deck` references the location; blocks with a clear error if a live `Deck` still owns it.
- `get_location_summary()` computes `is_deletable` per location (used by template to show/hide Delete); avoids duplicating the logic in the template.

### Deck/location UX fixes (v3.8.1)

- `GET /locations/{id}` redirects to `/decks/{deck_id}` when `location.type == "deck"` — eliminates duplicate access path.
- Deck detail gains sort controls (Name, Type, Mana Cost, Price) matching location detail.
- Import destination dropdowns (`import_preview.html`, `manual_preview.html`) exclude `type="deck"` locations from the Storage Locations optgroup — deck locations only appear under the Decks optgroup.
- `delete_location()` in `location_service.py` + `POST /locations/{id}/delete` route — deletes empty non-root, non-deck locations. Delete button appears in locations table only when `row_count == 0`.
- `location_types` in create form excludes "deck" — prevents creating orphaned deck-type StorageLocations not linked to a Deck record.
- Collection card actions collapsed into a `<details class="card-actions-drawer">` — cards show only info by default; "Actions ▾" expands Remove, Add to Deck, Move, and Sell/Trade/Delete/Refresh inline.
- Fixed deck card tile overflow: deck actions section now uses `flex-direction: column`; removed misapplied `compact-form-grid` class from return form.

### Boolean search logic (v3.8.5)

- `apply_collection_search_filters()` in `inventory_service.py` now parses full Scryfall-style boolean logic. Public signature unchanged — all three search surfaces (collection, location detail, deck detail) get the upgrade for free.
- **Operators**: `OR` (explicit), `AND` (explicit or implicit between adjacent terms), `-` prefix for negation (e.g. `-t:land`, `-folio`).
- **Grouping**: parentheses `(t:creature OR t:planeswalker)` for complex expressions.
- **Quoted multi-word values**: `t:"legendary creature"`, `o:"draw a card"`, `"lightning bolt"`.
- Implementation: `_tokenize_search()` → flat token list; `_term_to_clause()` → single SQLAlchemy clause; `_parse_search_expr()` / `_parse_and_expr()` / `_parse_atom()` → recursive-descent parser building nested `and_()` / `or_()` / `not_()` clauses.
- Malformed queries fall back to no-filter rather than 500.

### Search polish (v3.8.6)

- `OR` / `AND` keywords are now case-insensitive (`or`, `Or`, `OR` all work).
- `not:X` is syntactic sugar for `-is:X` (double-negation via `-not:X` cancels correctly).
- New keywords in `_term_to_clause()`:
  - `is:foil` / `is:nonfoil` / `is:etched` — finish filter; `not:foil` inverts
  - `is:commander` — cards flagged as commander in a deck
  - `n:` / `name:` — explicit name prefix (same as bare word, useful in complex expressions)
  - `qty:`/`q:`/`quantity:` — numeric quantity filter (e.g. `qty:>1` to find duplicates)
  - `price:`/`usd:` — numeric price filter against `Card.price_usd` cast to float (e.g. `price:>=5`)
- `id:` color identity filter: "within" subset check — excludes cards containing any color not in the given set. Uses `Card.color_identity` (exact Scryfall field, added v3.8.8); cards with `NULL` identity are excluded until backfilled.
- Placeholder text in all three search inputs updated to show real example queries with boolean syntax.

### Legality filter (v3.9.6)

- `Card.legalities` (TEXT, nullable) — JSON-encoded dict from Scryfall `legalities` field (e.g. `{"commander": "legal", "modern": "not_legal"}`). Added via migration `v3_9_6_legalities`. `NULL` = not yet fetched; backfilled by the price refresh loop.
- `_normalize_card_payload()` in `scryfall.py` now includes `"legalities": json.dumps(raw.get("legalities") or {})`. `refresh_card_from_scryfall()` writes `card.legalities`; price refresh loop does too.
- `get_card_legality(card, format_name) -> str | None` in `deck_service.py` — parses JSON, lowercases format name, returns legality value ("legal", "not_legal", "banned", "restricted") or None.
- Deck detail items dict includes `"legality_status": get_card_legality(row.card, deck.format)`.
- New search keywords in `_term_to_clause()`:
  - `legal:FORMAT` — cards legal in that format (e.g. `legal:commander`)
  - `banned:FORMAT` — cards banned in that format (e.g. `banned:modern`)
  - Both use SQLite `json_extract(legalities, '$.format')` comparison.
- Legality badge in `_macros.html` in deck context — shown only when status is not "legal" and not None: red "Banned", orange "Restricted", amber "Not Legal".
- CSS classes: `.legality-badge`, `.legality-banned`, `.legality-restricted`, `.legality-not-legal`.
- Deck format values are Title Case in UI ("Commander", "Modern") — `get_card_legality()` lowercases before JSON key lookup, so they match Scryfall's lowercase keys.

### Deck health (v3.9.0)

- `compute_deck_health(rows)` in `deck_service.py` — takes unfiltered `InventoryRow` ORM objects and returns four functional-density metrics plus pip strain analysis.
- **Functional density metrics** (each: `{count, cards, threshold}`):
  - **Ramp**: non-land cards with `"add {"` in oracle text + any non-basic card with a land-tutor pattern (`search your library for ... land`). Threshold: 10.
  - **Draw**: cards matching `draw (a|an|x|N|two–six|that many) cards?`. Threshold: 10.
  - **Removal**: cards matching `(destroy|exile) target ... (creature|artifact|enchantment|planeswalker|permanent)`. Threshold: 8.
  - **Board Wipes**: `destroy all`, `exile all creatures/permanents`, `all creatures get -N/-N`, `deals N damage to each creature`. Threshold: 2.
  - `count` = number of distinct card names; `cards` = sorted list for the expandable UI.
- **Pip strain** (`pip_strain` dict keyed by color letter):
  - `demand` = sum of colored pips of that color across all non-land `mana_cost` (quantity-weighted).
  - `sources` = sum of quantities of land cards whose `color_identity` contains that color.
  - `ratio` = demand/sources (or `None` if no sources); `strained = ratio > 2.5 or ratio is None`.
  - Only colors with nonzero demand are included.
- **Deck Health panel** in `deck_detail.html` — two-column layout: left = Functional Density rows (bar + count/threshold + expandable card list); right = Pip Strain rows (pip symbol + bar + demand/sources/ratio). Color-coded: green (at/above threshold), yellow (≥60%), red (<60%); strained pips shown in red.
- CSS classes: `.health-grid`, `.health-metrics`, `.health-pips`, `.health-row`, `.health-pip-row`, `.health-bar(-ok|-warn|-low)`, `.health-count(-ok|-warn|-low)`, `.health-cards-details`, `.health-cards-list`, `.pip-sym(-w|-u|-b|-r|-g)`.

### Self-service onboarding and display names (v3.10.6)

- `User.display_name` (String(64), nullable) — friendly name shown in the UI. Migration `v3_11_display_name` adds the column.
- Login uses `username` field (stored as email for new registrations). All UI shows `display_name or username` as the fallback — existing accounts (e.g. `jason.v`) continue to work unchanged.
- `POST /register` now requires email format (server-side `@` + domain check), collects Display Name, and auto-derives display name from email prefix if left blank.
- Login page links to `/register` — no admin involvement needed for new users.
- Admin Create User form accepts Display Name + Email fields.

### Editable locations and decks (v3.10.6)

- `update_location()` in `location_service.py` — edits name, type, parent_id, sort_order. Blocked on `root` and `deck` types.
- `update_deck()` in `deck_service.py` — edits name, format, notes. Also renames the linked `StorageLocation` to keep the import destination dropdown in sync.
- Routes: `POST /locations/{id}/edit`, `POST /decks/{id}/edit`.
- UI: floating `<details>` popout per row on `locations.html` and `decks.html` — uses `.inline-details` / `.edit-popout` / `.btn-like` CSS classes. The popout uses `position: absolute` so it overlays the table rather than pushing rows.

### Move cards from deck detail (v3.10.7–v3.10.8)

- `deck_detail_page` now fetches and passes `locations` to the template.
- Per-card **Move to Location** dropdown added to deck card actions in `_macros.html` (inside `show_deck_actions` block, after Remove from Deck). Uses `rejectattr("type", "equalto", "deck")` + `rejectattr("id", "equalto", deck.storage_location_id)` to split into Storage Locations / Decks optgroups, excluding the current deck.
- **Bulk Move** panel on deck detail — collapsible `<details>` above the card grid, same checklist pattern as location detail. Routes to `POST /decks/{id}/bulk-move`.
- Both dropdowns show `<optgroup label="Storage Locations">` and `<optgroup label="Decks">` with the current deck excluded from the deck group.

### Move cards from location detail (v3.10.6)

- `location_detail_page` now fetches and passes `locations` and `decks` to the template.
- `location_detail.html` calls `inventory_card` with `show_collection_actions=true` — gives full per-card actions (Move, Add to Deck, Remove, Sell, Trade, Delete, Refresh).
- **Bulk Move panel** — collapsible `<details>` above the card grid; shows a scrollable checkbox list of all cards in the location + a destination picker. "Select all" toggle via inline `onclick`. Submits to `POST /locations/{id}/bulk-move` which loops `move_inventory_row_to_location()` for each selected `row_id`.

### Win condition detection (v3.11.0)

- `app/spellbook.py` — `fetch_deck_combos(main_names, commander_names)` POSTs to `https://backend.commanderspellbook.com/find-my-combos/` with `{"commanders": [{"card": name}], "main": [{"card": name}]}`. Returns `{included, almost}`.
- `included` = combos where all pieces are in the deck. `almostIncluded` from the API response is ignored.
- 1-hour in-memory cache keyed on `(_COMBO_CACHE_VERSION, frozenset(all_names))`. Bump `_COMBO_CACHE_VERSION` in `spellbook.py` to invalidate.
- `compute_deck_combos(all_rows)` in `deck_service.py` — extracts commander vs main card names from `row.role`, calls `fetch_deck_combos`. Called from `deck_detail_page` on the unfiltered `all_deck_rows`.
- Each combo dict: `id, card_names, owned, missing, description, results, prerequisites, mana_needed, popularity`.
- **Win Conditions panel** in `deck_detail.html` — "Complete combos in this deck" section + "One card away" section. Each combo shows card pills (missing card styled in amber), result badges (green), expandable "How it works" with step-by-step description and setup prerequisites.
- CSS classes: `.combo-panel`, `.combo-section-label`, `.combo-item`, `.combo-item-almost`, `.combo-cards`, `.combo-card-name`, `.combo-card-missing`, `.combo-results`, `.combo-result-badge`, `.combo-details`, `.combo-summary`, `.combo-description`, `.combo-prereq`.

### Commander theme extraction (v3.11.11)

- `extract_commander_themes(commander_rows)` in `deck_service.py` — parses all commander oracle texts and returns a structured theme dict consumed by synergy, and in future by recommendations and health calibration.
- **Card types**: detected via positive patterns (`"whenever you cast a/an {type}"`, `"{type}s you control"`, `"{type} spells"`, etc.). Removal context (`"destroy/exile/counter target … {type}"`) is excluded to avoid false positives.
- **CMC gate**: `_CMC_MIN_RE` / `_CMC_MAX_RE` extract numeric thresholds from `"mana value N or greater/less"` phrases (e.g. Bello → `{"min": 4}`).
- **Non-X exclusions**: `_NON_SUBTYPE_RE` captures `"non-Aura"`, `"non-Human"` etc. → `excluded_subtypes` set applied when matching deck cards.
- **Mechanics**: counters, tokens, graveyard, sacrifice, discard detected from oracle text patterns.
- **Tribal subtypes**: extracted from commander type line but only included if the subtype also appears in oracle text (e.g. Edgar Markov mentions "Vampire" → tribal; Bello does not mention "Halfling" → no tribal).
- `card_matches_theme(card, themes)` — checks tribal, card type (with exclusions + CMC gate), and mechanics; used in `compute_deck_synergy()`.
- `extract_commander_themes` is the shared foundation for v3.12 owned recommendations and future health calibration.

### Commander Synergy score (v3.11.10)

- `compute_deck_synergy(all_rows, combos)` in `deck_service.py` — classifies each non-commander card into three buckets and returns counts, percentages, and card lists.
- **Direct**: card appears in a complete Spellbook combo, tagged Combo or Payoff, or shares a creature subtype with any commander (tribal match). Subtypes extracted from commander type line after "—".
- **Supporting**: tagged Ramp, Draw, Removal, Wipe, Tutor, or Protection; or is a Land. Direct takes priority if both apply.
- **Unrelated**: neither of the above.
- Returns `None` if no commander is tagged or deck is empty.
- **Synergy panel** in `deck_detail.html` — between Health and Combos panels. Shows a stacked horizontal bar (blue=direct, green=supporting, gray=unrelated) and three expandable stat blocks (dot + label + count/pct + scrollable card list in two columns). Tribal match note shown when commander has creature subtypes.
- CSS classes: `.synergy-bar`, `.synergy-seg`, `.synergy-seg-direct/supporting/unrelated`, `.synergy-stats`, `.synergy-stat`, `.synergy-stat-details`, `.synergy-dot`, `.synergy-stat-label`, `.synergy-stat-count`, `.synergy-stat-pct`, `.synergy-card-list`, `.synergy-subtype-note`.

### Commander Bracket estimation (v3.11.5)

- `compute_deck_bracket(all_rows, combos)` in `deck_service.py` — floor-based bracket estimator using multiple deck signals; returns `{bracket: 1-5, reasons: [...], signals: {...}}`.
- **Signal frozensets**: `_FAST_MANA` (Mana Crypt, Mox Diamond, Chrome Mox, Mox Opal, Jeweled Lotus, Grim Monolith, Mana Vault, Lotus Petal, Ancient Tomb), `_FREE_INTERACTION` (Force of Will, Force of Negation, Mana Drain, Fierce Guardianship, Deflecting Swat, Flusterstorm, Mental Misstep, Pact of Negation, Commandeer), `_MASS_LAND_DENIAL` (Armageddon, Ravages of War, Jokulhaups, Devastation, Obliterate, Decree of Annihilation, Catastrophe, Ruination, Boom // Bust).
- **Floor logic** (signals raise the minimum bracket):
  - Tutors (non-basic-land search) → floor 2
  - 1+ complete combo, 1+ mass land denial, or 1+ extra turn card → floor 3
  - Any fast mana or free interaction → floor 4
  - 2+ fast mana + 1+ free interaction + 2+ combos → bracket 5
- **Bracket badge** in deck detail hero stats — `<details class="bracket-details">` with `<summary class="bracket-badge bracket-N">` colored per bracket (1=green, 2=blue, 3=yellow, 4=orange, 5=red); click/open shows `.bracket-popout` with reasons list.
- CSS classes: `.bracket-details`, `.bracket-badge`, `.bracket-1` through `.bracket-5`, `.bracket-popout`, `.bracket-popout-title`, `.bracket-reasons`.

## Deployment and versioning

- CI builds and pushes to GHCR on any tag matching `v*.*.*`. Untagged commits run lint only.
- ArgoCD Image Updater (semver strategy) watches GHCR and writes the new tag to `.argocd-source-mana-archive.yaml` in `mana-archive-platform`, which ArgoCD then syncs to the cluster.
- **Version convention**: always bump the patch number — never use `-N` suffixes. `v3.8.9` → hotfix → `v3.8.10`. Semver treats `-N` as a pre-release (sorts _below_ the base tag) so the Image Updater ignores it.
- **Tagging is automatic**: the `.githooks/post-commit` hook tags HEAD whenever the commit message starts with `vX.Y.Z:`. No separate `git tag` step needed.
- New developers must run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to activate both the pre-commit lint check and the post-commit auto-tag.

- v3.8.5: Boolean search logic (OR, AND, NOT/-, parentheses, quoted multi-word values) — **shipped**
- v3.8.6: Search polish — case-insensitive OR/AND, not: keyword, is:/qty:/price:/name: keywords, updated placeholders — **shipped**
- v3.8.7: id: color identity filter bug fixes — NULL colors excluded by SQLite NOT LIKE; refresh loop now also picks up cards with NULL colors; one-time backfill via individual + set/collector Scryfall fallback fixed ~1,400 stale scryfall_ids — **shipped**
- v3.8.8: `color_identity` column on `Card` — proper Scryfall `color_identity` field (space-sep WUBRG, `""` = colorless, `NULL` = not yet fetched); `id:` filter now uses this instead of approximating from `colors`; migration `v3_8_8_color_identity` adds column; refresh loop and all card-write paths updated — **shipped**
- v3.8.9: Deck token panel (image grid, `/tokens/{scryfall_id}` detail page), collapse remove-from-deck overrides into `<details>`, post-commit auto-tag hook — **shipped**
- v3.8.10: Collection location filter now works for non-drawer locations (decks, custom storage); stats (total value, total cards, matching rows) also scoped correctly — **shipped**
- v3.9.0: Deck health panel — ramp/draw/removal/board-wipe density counts with recommended thresholds and expandable card lists; pip strain analysis (colored pip demand vs land color sources, ratio >2.5 flagged as strained) — **shipped**
- v3.9.1: Health metric chips link to filtered deck card list — **shipped**
- v3.9.2: Fix health_filter= param name mismatch — **shipped**
- v3.9.3: Enhanced mana curve — stacked bars (ramp/spells), avg threat turn estimate, dead-hand risk indicator (% CMC≥5) — **shipped**
- v3.9.4: Consistency score — draw/ramp/tutor/curve-smoothness/coverage → 0-100 score with label (Consistent engine → Glass cannon) and optional descriptor; compact header in health panel — **shipped**
- v3.9.5: Card role tagging — user-defined per-row tags (Ramp, Draw, Removal, Combo piece, Payoff, Protection, etc.); multi-role support; schema migration; unlocks deeper analytics — **shipped**
- v3.9.6: Legality filter — `Card.legalities` JSON column; `legal:FORMAT` / `banned:FORMAT` search keywords; legality badge (Banned/Restricted/Not Legal) on deck cards when format is set — **shipped**
- v3.9.7: Legalities backfill — added `Card.legalities == None` to refresh loop stale filter so existing cards get legalities populated — **shipped**
- v3.9.8: Auto-tag untagged deck rows from oracle text on deck load (Ramp/Draw/Removal/Wipe) — **shipped**
- v3.9.9: Mana pip size 20→24px, added drop-shadow — **shipped**
- v3.10.0–v3.10.4: Mana pip SVGs — iterative replacement; final v3.10.4 uses Scryfall card-symbols SVGs directly (`svgs.scryfall.io/card-symbols/{W,U,B,R,G}.svg`). Structure: colored circle background + `#0D0F0F` positive-space symbol path. Colorless (C) still uses Scryfall CDN in `_macros.html` — **shipped**
- v3.10.5: Fix missing `.stack-form` CSS — labels and inputs were rendering inline in all browsers — **shipped**
- v3.10.6: Self-service onboarding, fully editable locations/decks, move cards from location detail — **shipped**
- v3.10.7: Move cards feature on deck detail — per-card Move to Location dropdown + Bulk Move panel — **shipped**
- v3.10.8: Move destination dropdowns include other decks; Storage Locations / Decks optgroups — **shipped**
- v3.10.9: Fix partner commander color identity — union all commanders' `color_identity` (not `.first()` + `colors`); affects both decks list and deck detail header — **shipped**
- v3.11.0: Win condition detection — CommanderSpellbook API integration; `app/spellbook.py` POSTs deck card list to `/find-my-combos/`; shows complete combos in deck + "one card away" near-combos (missing exactly 1 card, top 10 by popularity); 1-hour in-memory cache keyed on card set; combo panel in `deck_detail.html` with card pills, result badges, and expandable step-by-step description — **shipped**

### Mana pip SVG notes

- Local files at `app/static/mana/{W,U,B,R,G}.svg` — downloaded directly from `svgs.scryfall.io/card-symbols/`.
- Structure: `<circle fill="<mana-color>"/>` + `<path fill="#0D0F0F"/>` (positive-space symbol).
- Rendered at 24×24px via `.mana-pip` CSS class with drop-shadow filter.
- Colorless (C) pip still served from Scryfall CDN in `mana_pips` macro in `_macros.html`.
- To update: re-download from Scryfall CDN; the B symbol uses `fill-rule="evenodd"` for skull detail holes.

- v3.11.1: Collapse deck card actions behind "Actions" toggle — wraps tag editor, Mark/Remove Commander, Remove from Deck, and Move to Location inside `<details class="card-actions-drawer">` to match collection card behavior; tag role badges remain always visible — **shipped**
- v3.11.2: Remove "one card away" near-combos from Win Conditions panel — show only complete combos present in the deck; trim almostIncluded processing from spellbook.py — **shipped**
- v3.11.3: Fix resort_collection and list_pending_rows including deck cards — both functions now outerjoin StorageLocation and exclude rows where type="deck"; deck cards no longer appear in Pending Placement; migration `v3_11_3_clear_deck_pending` clears is_pending on any deck rows already incorrectly flagged — **shipped**
- v3.11.4: Tag current HEAD to trigger CI build including recovery script and linter-reformatted templates; no functional changes — **shipped**
- v3.11.5: Commander Bracket estimation — floor-based 1-5 bracket estimator using fast mana, free interaction, combos, tutors, mass land denial, extra turns; bracket badge with color-coded popout reasons in deck detail hero — **shipped**
- v3.11.6: Bracket badge on decks list — `list_decks()` computes bracket per deck (full Spellbook combo data via cache); Bracket column added to decks table — **shipped**
- v3.11.7: Decks list bracket uses full combo data (same as deck detail) — `list_decks()` calls `compute_deck_combos` + `compute_deck_bracket`; Spellbook in-memory cache means warm loads add zero API calls — **shipped**
- v3.11.8: Bracket 1 reason + deck export — Bracket 1 now shows a reason ("no tutors, fast mana…") in its popout; `GET /decks/{id}/export` returns a plain-text download in standard `N CardName (SET) #collector` format with Commander/Deck sections; Export button in deck detail hero — **shipped**
- v3.11.9: Health score on decks list — `list_decks()` also computes `compute_consistency()`; Health column shows the 0-100 badge (same `.consistency-badge.cs-*` classes) with label as tooltip — **shipped**
- v3.11.10: Commander synergy score — `compute_deck_synergy(all_rows, combos)` classifies each non-commander card as Direct (combo piece, Combo/Payoff tag, or shares commander creature subtype), Supporting (engine tags or land), or Unrelated; stacked bar + three expandable stat blocks in deck detail between Health and Combos panels — **shipped**
- v3.11.14: Remove "creature" from card type detection — generic "creature" caused false positives whenever oracle text described something becoming a creature (e.g. Bello "is a 4/4 Elemental creature"); tribal synergy is already handled by the subtype mechanism — **shipped**
- v3.11.15: Lazy-load slow deck panels — `deck_detail_page` now returns immediately (analytics/health/consistency only); bracket badge, synergy, combos, and tokens load via `GET /decks/{id}/panels` HTML fragment endpoint after page paint; JS uses `DOMParser` + `outerHTML`/`replaceWith` to swap bracket placeholder in hero and panels container below the card grid; `_deck_panels.html` fragment template; `{% block extra_scripts %}` added to `base.html`; panels endpoint runs `compute_deck_tokens` + `compute_deck_combos` in parallel (`ThreadPoolExecutor`); results disk-cached in `/data/panels_cache/{deck_id}.json` (24h TTL, keyed on hash of card set + quantities, survives restarts); also fixed catastrophic regex backtracking in `_CARE_ABOUT_PATTERNS` — `(?:\w+[-\w]* )*` replaced with `[^.;]*` making `compute_deck_synergy` drop from ~50s to <1ms — **shipped**
- v3.11.20: Batch Scryfall lookups on import preview — `parse_scanner_csv` (3-pass: parse → batch by ID via `bulk_refresh_prices` + batch by set/collector via `bulk_fetch_by_set_number` → apply) and `parse_text_list` (2-pass: parse all lines → batch-fetch all set+collector pairs, then individual name lookups for the rest) now make O(N/75) requests instead of O(N); `persist_import_rows` also batch-fetches new cards not yet in the local DB via `bulk_refresh_prices` instead of one call per missing card — **committed**
- v3.11.19: Optimise resort_collection for large batches — pre-load all 6 drawer StorageLocations in one query (was 6 separate queries); compute `assign_drawer` once per row instead of twice; replace N individual ORM UPDATE statements with a single `executemany` SQL batch; only write audit log entries for cross-drawer physical moves, not same-drawer slot renumbering (eliminates O(N) inserts for bulk imports) — **shipped**
- v3.11.18: Fix import resort race condition — resort now runs synchronously (same session, same request) in both CSV and manual commit handlers for drawer-sorter users, replacing the background thread approach; eliminates race condition where `/pending` loaded before the background thread committed, causing cards to display as "Drawer - · Slot ?" — **shipped**
- v3.11.17: Auto-resort on non-deck import for drawer-sorter users — both CSV and manual commit handlers now fire `_bg_resort` after `place_imported_rows()` whenever the target location is not a deck and the user is in `DRAWER_SORTER_USERNAMES`; previously resort only ran on the "Auto-sort" (no location) path — **shipped**
- v3.11.16: Death trigger synergy detection + collection/location CSV export — `extract_commander_themes` adds `death_triggers` mechanic when commander oracle contains `"dying"` or a `when(?:ever)?[^.;]*\bdies` pattern (catches Teysa, Erebos, etc.); `card_matches_theme` adds matching check so cards with "when/whenever X dies" triggers are classified Direct; token detection also triggers on `"tokens you control"` without requiring `"create"`; `_PANELS_CACHE_VERSION` bumped to 2 to invalidate stale synergy caches; `GET /collection/export` returns full user collection as CSV; `GET /locations/{id}/export` returns that location's cards as CSV; both use columns Name/Set/Collector Number/Finish/Quantity/Location; Export CSV buttons added to collection controls panel and location detail hero — **shipped**
- v3.11.13: Fix theme extraction for compound noun structures — `each` pattern now handles modifier words (`each non-Equipment artifact`); conjunction patterns now handle `and` as well as `or` (`artifact and non-Aura enchantment`); both fixes required for Bello-style oracle text — **shipped**
- v3.11.12: Fix theme extraction missing "X or Y" card types — add `{t} or \w+` and `\w+ or {t}` patterns so "enchantment or artifact" correctly detects both types — **shipped**
- v3.11.11: Commander theme extraction — `extract_commander_themes()` parses commander oracle text for card types cared about (positive pattern matching, removal context excluded), CMC gates (mana value N or greater/less), non-X subtype exclusions, mechanics (counters/tokens/graveyard/sacrifice/discard), and tribal subtypes (only when mentioned in oracle text); `card_matches_theme()` applies themes to classify deck cards; `compute_deck_synergy()` now uses these instead of ad-hoc subtype matching; "Detected:" note in synergy panel shows extracted signals — **shipped**
- v3.12.0: Dead card detection — `compute_dead_cards(all_rows, synergy)` in `deck_service.py` flags Unrelated cards (per synergy classification) that have no user-assigned role tag; oracle text patterns add sub-reasons: `win-more` (`for each creature/token/permanent you control`) and `board-dependent` (sacrifice a creature, tap untapped creatures, convoke); **Upgrade Targets** panel in `_deck_panels.html` shows count + expandable card list with sub-reason tags; CSS: `.dead-cards-panel`, `.dead-cards-note`, `.dead-cards-details`, `.dead-cards-summary`, `.dead-cards-list`, `.dead-card-name`, `.dead-card-tag` — **committed**
- v3.13: Average turn impact — estimate when cards are typically playable and when they matter; "deck peaks at turn X" summary
- v3.13.0: Game tracker — `Game` + `GameSeat` models; migration `v3_13_games`; `app/game_service.py` (`create_game`, `get_game`, `list_games`, `end_game`, `delete_game`, `get_deck_record`); routes `GET/POST /games`, `GET /games/new`, `GET/POST /games/{id}`, `POST /games/{id}/end`, `POST /games/{id}/delete`; `games.html` (history table with winner), `game_new.html` (JS seat builder, 2–8 players, deck selection), `game_detail.html` (client-side life tracker with ±1/±5 buttons, End Game form with per-seat placement + final life); W/L record shown in deck detail hero when games exist; Games nav link in `base.html`; CSS: `.life-tracker-grid`, `.life-card`, `.life-total`, `.life-controls`, `.life-btn`, `.end-game-row`, `.seat-row`, `.deck-record` — **shipped**
- v3.13.1: Full game tracker redesign — `game_detail.html` rebuilt as LifeTap-style app: ±1/±5/±10 life buttons, per-player commander damage matrix (collapsible `<details>`, auto-decrements receiver's life), poison (☣) and experience (⚡) counters with thresholds, turn counter + recent action history bar, undo (reverses last action including both sides of cmd damage), elimination toggle (☠ grays card), auto-win detection fills placements + opens End Game when 1 player alive, localStorage persistence keyed by `mana-game-{gameId}`, 8 per-player colors via CSS `--player-color`; `game_new.html` expanded to include all active users in seat dropdowns (not just current user) with deck list filtered per selected user via `decksByUser` JS map; seat 0 pre-populated with current user and their decks; auto-fills player name from display name; `main.py` `game_new_page` now fetches all active users + all decks grouped by `user_id`; CSS: `.tracker-grid`, `.tracker-card`, `.tc-life`, `.tc-eliminated`, `.tc-cmd-grid`, `.tc-counter-row`, `.turn-bar`, `.history-bar` — **shipped**
- v3.13.2: Tablet-optimized game tracker layout — full-screen fixed overlay covers nav; JS `LAYOUTS` config per player count (2–8) sets CSS `grid-template-areas` and applies seat rotations so bottom-row cards face near players (0°) and top-row cards face far players (180°); CSS mirrors `flex-direction` for rotated cards so +/- buttons read intuitively from both sides; floating `.game-topbar` pill at top center (turn, undo, End Game, ← Games); floating `.game-histbar` at bottom center; End Game is a `.end-game-modal` overlay; touch-friendly life buttons (`min-height: 48px`); life total scales via `clamp(2.5rem, 8vh, 7rem)` — **shipped**
- v3.13.4: Fix empty space in compass/triangle/long-table layouts — remove `.` placeholder cells; Triangle now `"top top" / "l r"`, Compass now `"top top" / "l r" / "bot bot"`, 5/7-player long tables restructured to sides-only (2+2+1 and 3+3+1) with no unassigned grid cells — **shipped**
- v3.13.5: Fix Compass corner gaps — side players (`l`/`r`) now span full height via repeated grid-area names (`"l top r" "l bot r"`); top/bot fill the center column between them; Triangle similarly collapsed to `"l top r"` single-row so all three cells are full-height — **shipped**
- v3.13.6: Fix rotated side-player cards not filling their grid cells — add `.card-slot` wrapper div as the actual grid item; `.tracker-card` is `position: absolute; inset: 0; margin: auto` inside it; JS `sizeRotatedCards()` sets `width = slotHeight; height = slotWidth` for 90°/270° cards so the card fills the cell correctly after CSS `rotate()`; resize listener re-runs on orientation change — **committed**
- v3.13.3: Playmat backgrounds, seat-orientation picker, 90°/270° rotations, touch polish — `.game-app` dark green felt background (radial gradient + dot-pattern texture); each player card has a per-color radial glow gradient on `#13180f` base; `LAYOUT_OPTIONS` per player count with 2 presets each: standard split and "Long Table" variant (2 side players at 90°/270°); `⊞ Layout` button in topbar opens `.layout-picker-popover` with named layout buttons; chosen layout saved to `mana-layout-N` localStorage key; CSS rules for 90° and 270° rotated cards mirror life-section flex-direction; counter buttons enlarged to 32px with `touch-action: manipulation` and `:active` scale feedback; life buttons `min-height: 52px` with press animation — **committed**
- v3.14.0: Fixed 8-seat topology + per-seat position picker — replaced dynamic layout presets with a fixed 3×3 grid (P1-P3 top row, P8 left end, P4 right end, P7-P5 bottom row, `tc` center); `GameSeat.grid_position` column (migration `v3_14_seat_position`) stores the assigned position; `game_new.html` gains a click-to-assign seat diagram showing the physical table topology — click a "Seat X" pill to enter assignment mode, click a position on the diagram to assign; default positions auto-populated per player count; `game_detail.html` reads stored `grid_position` from DB, falls back to default positions, then renders only the used seats with empty placeholder divs for unused cells; clockwise turn order badge (`.tc-seat-badge`) shows turn number; C/P/E counter pills (`.tc-cpill-row`); center `tc` cell shows turn counter + active player name + `→ Next` button; `POSITION_ROTATE` maps each position to 0°/90°/180°/270° so cards face the nearest player; CSS: fixed `grid-template-areas: "p1 p2 p3" / "p8 tc p4" / "p7 p6 p5"`, `.card-slot-center`, `.turn-center`, `.turn-center-round`, `.turn-center-name`, `.turn-next-btn`, `.tc-seat-badge`, `.tc-active-turn`, `.tc-cpill-row`, `.tc-cpill`, `.seat-pos-pill`, `.seat-diagram-wrap`, `.seat-diagram`, `.sd-top-row`, `.sd-mid-row`, `.sd-bot-row`, `.sd-seat`, `.sd-seat-filled`, `.sd-seat-pending`, `.sd-seat-inactive`, `.sd-center` — **shipped**
- v3.16.1: Token cataloging round-2 polish — six follow-up commits bundled. (1) **DFC picker** on `/tokens/new` shows BOTH faces side-by-side and surfaces double-faced printings to the top of the result list (older DFC printings were getting buried under newer single-sided ones in release-desc order). (2) **'Look up back' button** for DFC sets Scryfall doesn't model (TMH3, etc.) — when the user checks Double-sided, a Back-face fieldset reveals with set + collector inputs and a button that triggers a second Scryfall fetch. Migration `v3_16_1_token_back_set_collector` adds `back_set_code` + `back_collector_number` columns so the lookup state persists. (3) **Cross-set DFC support** — `_get_owned_token_map` in `set_service.py` now counts BOTH the front (`set_code` + `collector_number`) AND the back (`back_set_code` + `back_collector_number`) when summing owned tokens for set-completion. So a TBLB#3 // TBLC#14 token contributes to ownership of both sets. Edit popout on `/tokens` gained the same Back-face fieldset + Look-up-back JS as the new-token form. Token list "Token" column shows `Front / Back` name pair plus `SET#N / SET#N` when the row is DFC, with both face thumbnails stacked in the image popout. (4) **Bulk add page** at `/tokens/bulk-add` — paste-list textarea + shared storage location + default qty. Whitespace-separated, field count picks the line type: 2 fields = single-sided, 3 = single + qty, 4 = DFC, 5 = DFC + qty. Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are ignored. `parse_bulk_token_lines` validates field count and qty before any network calls; per-row Scryfall lookups (~80ms throttled = ~0.2s per row) create `TokenInventory` rows; errors per line surface back with the raw line preserved. (5) **Image popout side placement** — `.inline-details-side` modifier opens the image preview to the right of the trigger instead of below, so it doesn't push table rows when the token image is taller than the row height. (6) Substitute cards (SZNR) bug fix: earlier accidentally flagged them as double-sided based on set name; corrected — they have standard MTG backs and are physically single-sided — **committed**
- v3.16.0: Token cataloging — lightweight gameplay-focused token tracking per the spec. Two new tables (migration `v3_16_0_token_inventory`): `token_inventory` (per-user physical token rows: name, qty, subtype, storage_location_id, double-sided support, optional Scryfall metadata) and `deck_token_requirements` (per-deck "this deck needs N of token X"). Models: `TokenInventory` + `DeckTokenRequirement`. Separate from `InventoryRow` so resort_collection / drawer-sorter logic doesn't touch tokens. New `app/token_service.py`: CRUD + `deck_token_status()` for the deck-detail "Tokens Needed" table (joins requirements to inventory by id or by fuzzy name match). Routes: `/tokens` (list with filters), `/tokens/new`, `POST /tokens/create`, `POST /tokens/{id}/edit`, `POST /tokens/{id}/delete`, `POST /decks/{id}/tokens/add`, `POST /decks/{id}/tokens/{r}/delete`. **Scryfall integration on the new-token form**: live `<datalist>` autocomplete (200ms debounce, 2+ chars), "Look up exact" button (requires set + collector — auto-tries `t`-prefix for the token-set convention; "BIG"/"big"/"tbig" all resolve to the Golem token in `tbig`), "Search by name" button that returns up to 12 matches as a clickable image grid for visual disambiguation (Treasure has 25+ printings, Goblin dozens — pick by image). New `app/scryfall.py` helpers: `autocomplete_token_names`, `fetch_token_by_name`, `fetch_token_by_set_number`, `search_tokens_by_name`. Three GET endpoints: `/tokens/api/autocomplete`, `/tokens/api/lookup` (requires set+collector, returns 400 otherwise), `/tokens/api/search`. **Set-detail token completion**: `show_tokens` now defaults to `True`; ownership sourced from `token_inventory` (NOT `inventory_rows`) via `_get_owned_token_map` matching on `(set_code, collector_number)` with leading zeros stripped, case-insensitive. Set-detail token grid shows green-bordered "Owned · N" tiles vs amber "Missing" tiles plus a completion percentage. **Substitute cards** (`s{set_code}` like SZNR for Zendikar Rising Substitute Cards) are appended at the end of the token list with a "Substitute" badge — these are single-sided placeholder cards with standard MTG backs used in lieu of DFCs in clear sleeves. They're detected as `set_type: token` with `layout: normal` and empty `card_faces`, so `is_double_sided` correctly stays False. Hide-tokens toggle preserves state across All/Owned/Missing tab clicks via explicit `&show_tokens=true|false` in the query string. Nav link "Tokens" added between Decks and Games — **committed**
- v3.15.1: Bracket V2 polish — soft power score (Section 3 Step 3) + clearer signal-density label. `compute_soft_score` aggregates fast_mana, tutor density, free interaction, draw/engine count, mana base quality, combo role, stax count, minus pip-strain penalty into a 0-100 score persisted on `deck_bracket_estimates`. Per spec the score is informational, never bracket-pushing — closes the visibility gap for decks that play harder than their mechanical bracket suggests (e.g., a casual deck reads B1 mechanically but score 31 surfaces the Sol Ring + incidental combo + engine cards). Displayed in the bracket panel as `Mechanical signal: 1 · Power score 31/100`. Also renamed the "Tagging coverage" confidence bar to "Bracket Signal Density" with a tooltip — the metric measures % of non-basic cards firing bracket-relevant primary signals; casual decks expectedly low, cEDH expectedly high. The old name implied missing data, the new name describes what the value actually is — **committed**
- v3.15.0: Bracket Estimator V2 — full V1+V2+V3 implementation per spec. Replaces the floor-based `compute_deck_bracket` with a multi-stage pipeline (mechanics + intent + combo role) that surfaces explainable findings instead of opaque numbers. New module `app/bracket_v2_service.py`. **V1 (foundation)**: 5 new tables — `commander_bracket_rules` (configurable tier thresholds, seeded with v1.0.0 defaults), `game_changer_cards` (seeded from Scryfall `is:gamechanger` query — 53 cards live; falls back to a hardcoded list if Scryfall unreachable), `card_tags` (per-card primary tags: fast*mana, free_interaction, unconditional_tutor, restricted_tutor, mass_land_denial, extra_turn, stax — separate from per-row `InventoryRow.tags` which still drive Synergy/Health), `deck_bracket_estimates`, `deck_bracket_findings`. Hard-rule floors per Section 3 Step 2 only: GC count via tier rules, MLD, extra-turn chains. Auto-tagger via oracle-text rules (`tag_card_from_oracle`) seeds `card_tags` on migration. **V2 (intent + confidence)**: 5 `intent*\*`columns on`decks`(pod/speed/combo/winning/played) populated by a 5-question survey form;`derive_intent_bracket`maps answers to a 1-5 bracket with hard overrides (cedh→5, groaned→≥4);`resolve_mechanics_intent`implements Section 3 Step 6 resolution table (match → 1.0 alignment; off-by-1 → 0.7 + close-call note; off-by-2+ mech-higher → 0.3 + critical pod-mismatch finding; off-by-2+ intent-higher → final = intent + info note). Four confidence dimensions stored on each estimate; tagging-coverage warning is suppressed for now (V1 auto-tagger only fires on bracket-relevant signals so casual decks legitimately show low coverage). **V3 (combo intelligence)**:`derive_combo_role` classifies each deck into none / incidental / backup / primary / compact based on combo count, tutor density, and commander participation. Reuses the existing Spellbook integration (`compute_deck_combos`); V3 runs synchronously in `deck_detail_page`when the panels cache is warm and is re-persisted from`panels_endpoint`after cold-cache fetches.`confidence_combo_detection_depth` = 1.0 when combos fed in. UI: new "Bracket Estimate (v2 preview)" panel below the deck hero with mechanics/intent badges, confidence bars, expandable findings list, and intent-survey form. Old bracket badge in the hero (lazy-loaded) stays in place; the two run alongside per the V1 cutover plan. Validation against real decks (intent unanswered): Teysa Karlov reads B4 (4 complete combo lines → primary + 2 Game Changers); Bello reads B1 (1 incidental combo, no GC, no MLD); Food/5c read B1 (no signals) — **committed**
- v3.14.20: Pre-v4 polish bundle — five small features rolled into one tag. (1) **Pattern gap fixes** in `deck_service.py`: Wipe regex now catches Promise-of-Loyalty's "each player ... sacrifices the rest" wording; Engine regex catches Victimize-style recursion ("creature cards in your graveyard ... return ... to the battlefield" without "from your graveyard"); `card_matches_theme` tokens-mechanic now also matches "becomes a token" and "tokens you control" so cards like Silverquill Lecturer (demonstrate creates token-copies) register as Synergy. (2) **Retag button** on deck detail (`POST /decks/{id}/retag`) walks every row, unions current `suggest_card_roles()` output with existing tags. Additive only — never strips user tags. (3) **Stale tag scrub migration** `v3_14_20_scrub_legacy_tags` parses `inventory_rows.tags` JSON and rewrites without legacy Combo/Payoff. Idempotent; runs once on startup. (4) **Update Profile form** at `/account` (`POST /account/update-profile`) lets any user change email + display name. Validates basic email shape and uniqueness. Unblocks future user migrations from requiring admin DB access. (5) **Peak turn analytics** — `compute_deck_analytics` returns `peak_turn` (CMC bucket with most non-ramp threats, ramp-adjusted) and `peak_threat_count`; shown in deck-detail mana-curve insight strip alongside avg-turn and dead-hand risk — **committed**
- v3.14.19: Collection stat counts unique cardnames + drop legacy DRAWER_SORTER entry — `get_inventory_row_stats()` in `inventory_service.py` now returns `unique_cards` as the count of distinct `card.name` values across the matching rows (set-based), rather than a per-row counter that was effectively duplicating `total_count`. Stat-card label on `collection.html` renamed "Matching rows" → "Unique Cardnames" to match. Pagination footer text ("X matching rows") left alone — that's row-count semantics. Also dropped the legacy `jason.v` entry from `DRAWER_SORTER_USERNAMES` now that prod's user row is renamed and validated under the new email — **committed**
- v3.14.18: jason.v account migrated to email-based username — `users.username` updated `jason.v` → `jason@vanfreckle.com` in both dev and prod DBs (one-shot UPDATE, no schema change). `display_name` set to `CoruscantSunrise`. `DRAWER_SORTER_USERNAMES` in `app/dependencies.py` carries both `jason.v` and `jason@vanfreckle.com` transitionally so a partial-deploy state isn't broken; once the prod row is verified renamed, the legacy `jason.v` entry can be removed in a follow-up commit.

- v3.14.17: Bulk Move "Return to Sorter" option — drawer-sorter users see a "Return to Sorter" entry in the destination dropdown of the deck Bulk Move panel. Selecting it loops `return_card_from_deck` over each chosen row (which removes from the deck and creates pending rows), then fires `_bg_resort` so the auto-sorter places them into drawers. `target_location_id` is now `str` to accept the "sorter" sentinel; numeric values still parse as the previous integer location-id flow. Server-side guard ensures non-drawer-sorter users hitting the "sorter" path silently no-op — **committed**
- v3.14.16: Clearer deck count labels — `deck_detail.html` hero now shows "N Unique Cards" / "N Total Cards" instead of "entries"/"copies". `decks.html` stat-grid label "Cards in Decks" → "Total Cards in Decks"; table column "Cards" → "Total Cards" — **committed**
- v3.14.15: Auto-detect Engine/Synergy/Threat/Hate + tighten existing patterns to better match user-curated tags. Validated against the Teysa Karlov deck in prod (75 cards): 32→41 exact matches, 36→8 misses, 7→5 disagreements. Changes: (a) **Engine** — sac outlets (`sacrifice (a|an|another) X:` with colon delimiting activation cost, dropped comma to avoid Bargain-cost false positives like Beseech the Mirror) and graveyard recursion (`(return|put) ... from ... graveyard ... (to|onto) the battlefield`, broader phrasing catches Junji's "Put X from a graveyard onto the battlefield" alongside Reassembling Skeleton's "Return X from your graveyard to the battlefield"). (b) **Threat** — kept narrow: `you win the game`, opponent/player loses-game, infect/toxic, extra combat phase/turn. Dropped `each opponent loses N life` (Bastion of Remembrance / Embalmed Ascendant per-trigger pings) and `cast without paying mana cost` (Beseech the Mirror bargain) — both too noisy. P/T-based threat detection isn't possible since `Card` has no power/toughness fields, so soft creature-threats are intentionally missed (manual tagging). (c) **Hate** — graveyard exile (target/each player's graveyard, "would ... graveyard ... exile ... instead"), opp-stax (`opponents can't cast/draw/etc`), enter-tapped slowdowns (Authority of the Consuls), draw hate (`whenever an opponent draws a card`), `each opponent skips`. (d) **Synergy** — uses commander themes via `card_matches_theme`. New `suggest_card_roles(card, themes=None)` signature; main.py extracts commander themes once per deck-load and passes to all `suggest_card_roles` calls. Expanded for death-trigger commanders: Engine cards (sac outlets/recursion) auto-tag Synergy too. Gating on Engine (rather than raw "sacrifice in oracle") prevents false positives from self-sac lands like Myriad Landscape and bargain-cost cards. (e) **Tightened existing**: edicts (`(target|each) (opponent|player) sacrifices a creature`) moved from Wipe to Removal — Plaguecrafter, Demon's Disciple, Eldest Reborn now correctly classified. Mass damage in Wipe restricted to `each (creature|other creature)`, removed `each (opponent|player)` to fix Syr Konrad / Serrated Scorpion misclassification. Added `destroy each (creature|permanent)` for Promise-of-Loyalty-style wipes. New `_QUOTED_ABILITY_RE` strips quoted token-grant text before checking ramp patterns — fixes Sifter of Skulls being tagged Ramp via the token's "Add {C}" reminder. New `\badds? [^.]{0,60}\{[wubrgcxs\d]\}` ramp alt catches Soldevi Adnate's "add an amount of {B}" — **committed**
- v3.14.14: Expanded role-tag auto-detection from oracle text — patterns in `deck_service.py` now catch significantly more cards. RAMP: split into `_RAMP_LAND_RE` (anchored to "your library" so opponent-search effects like Demolition Field/Strip Mine/Ghost Quarter/Path to Exile don't trigger Ramp; basic-land subtypes added so Nature's Lore is detected) and `_RAMP_NON_LAND_RE` (mana abilities `add {`/`add one mana`/`add ... mana of any`, treasure tokens, cost reduction, additional land drops, mana doublers — gated to non-land cards). REMOVAL: now catches counterspells, bounce (`return target ... to owner's hand`), damage to target/any target, debuffs (`gets -X/-X`), fight effects, edicts, and land destruction. WIPE: adds bounce wipes (`return all ... to`), `-X/-X` variants, mass edicts (`each player sacrifices`), `each opponent` damage, and Overload-keyword cards. DRAW: adds impulse draw (`exile the top ... may cast/play`), wheel effects (`each player draws`), and reveal-and-put-into-hand patterns (Dark Confidant). PROTECTION: newly auto-detected — `you control` near hexproof/indestructible/shroud/protection from, `gains {keyword}`, damage prevention, `would die ... instead`, regenerate target. Trigger-condition guard: `_TRIGGER_DRAW_RE` strips `Whenever a player draws a card,` style trigger conditions before re-checking, so Sheoldred and Underworld Dreams aren't tagged Draw, but Mangara and Skullclamp (where the draw is the trigger consequence) still are. `compute_deck_health`/`compute_consistency`/`compute_deck_analytics` updated to use the new ramp pattern; all three already honor user role tags from v3.14.12. New tags Engine/Synergy/Threat/Hate stay user-only (too contextual). Auto-tag-on-deck-load (v3.9.8) only re-tags rows with NULL tags, so existing tagged rows aren't disturbed — but the suggestions list in the tag editor reflects the new patterns immediately — **committed**
- v3.14.13: Redesigned role tag taxonomy — `CARD_ROLE_TAGS` becomes `[Ramp, Draw, Tutor, Removal, Wipe, Protection, Engine, Synergy, Threat, Hate]`. Combo and Payoff are dropped; legacy values are silently filtered out by `get_row_tags()` (so existing rows persist Combo/Payoff in their JSON until re-saved, but never surface in UI or analytics). New tags: Engine (sac outlets, free-activation engines, strategy enablers — Carrion Feeder, Ashnod's Altar, Skullclamp); Synergy (cards that benefit from your strategy executing — replaces Payoff conceptually but narrower in spirit); Threat (win conditions and pressure pieces); Hate (meta disruption — Leyline of the Void, Bojuka Bog). `compute_deck_synergy` Direct bucket now keys on Synergy + Threat tags (was Combo + Payoff); Supporting bucket keys on Ramp/Draw/Removal/Wipe/Tutor/Protection/Engine/Hate. New tags are user-only (no `suggest_card_roles` auto-detection — Engine/Threat/Hate are too contextual to detect reliably). CSS: removed `.card-tag-combo`/`.card-tag-payoff`; added `.card-tag-engine` (#c46a20), `.card-tag-synergy` (#b04080), `.card-tag-threat` (#c43a2a), `.card-tag-hate` (#4a5060) — **committed**
- v3.14.12: Health/consistency/curve metrics honor user role tags — `compute_deck_health`, `compute_consistency`, and `compute_mana_curve` in `deck_service.py` now union `get_row_tags(row)` with the existing oracle-text regex matches. Previously a card manually tagged "Removal" wouldn't count toward the Health panel's removal threshold unless its oracle matched the strict `(destroy|exile) target ... (creature|artifact|enchantment|planeswalker|permanent)` pattern, missing counterspells, bounce, damage-based removal, edicts, debuffs, etc. Now the regex handles automatic detection and the user tag acts as a manual override (Ramp/Draw/Removal/Wipe in `compute_deck_health`; Ramp/Draw/Removal/Tutor in `compute_consistency`; Ramp in the curve split). Loop also no longer short-circuits on empty oracle so tag-only matches still work; basic lands are still skipped. Panels cache version unchanged (health/consistency/curve aren't cached) — **committed**
- v3.14.11: Centered player names + MTG auto-elimination — `.tc-names` (player name + deck label) moved out of `.tc-header` into `.tc-life-center`, sitting centered just above the life total. `.tc-header` now right-aligns its single child (elim button or placement badge). New `checkElimination(seatId)` helper auto-sets `state.eliminated[seatId]=true` when the seat hits any MTG loss condition: life ≤ 0, poison ≥ 10, or cmd damage from any single commander ≥ 21. Called from `adjustLife`, `adjustPoison`, `adjustCmd` after history push and before save/render. Auto-elim is one-way (dead stays dead per MTG rules); `toggleEliminate` still works for manual revive — **committed**
- v3.14.10: Fix end-seat (side player) over-constrained CSS positioning — base `.tracker-card` has `position:absolute; inset:0; margin:auto`, which when combined with JS-set explicit width/height creates an over-constrained layout that resolves differently across browsers (often as a thin sliver clipped to almost nothing). Override for 90°/270° rotated cards: `inset: auto; margin: 0; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(...)` — unambiguously centers the card at the slot center via translate, then rotates around that origin. Affects 3-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-player layouts (any with an endcap seat) — **committed**
- v3.14.9: Force synchronous reflow + 25%-wide tall side strips — `sizeRotatedCards()` was running only via `requestAnimationFrame` after `buildDynamicGrid()`, but for the tall-side rotated cards the slot's `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` could still be stale (or 0 on first paint), leaving the rotated card at default `inset:0` which produced an invisible thin sliver. Now: read `gridEl.offsetHeight` (forces a sync reflow), call `sizeRotatedCards()` synchronously, then schedule a second RAF call for any post-paint adjustments (fullscreen transitions, orientation changes). Bumped sides from 6/36 (~17%) to 9/36 (25%) so the side player is visually substantial — **committed**
- v3.14.8: Side seats are ALWAYS tall narrow strips — removed the conflict-check that was making side players "short" (middle-row only) when p1/p3/p5/p7 were also present; now `tallP4`/`tallP8` are simply truthy whenever the side seat exists. Top/bottom row players always live in the inner column range and coexist with the tall side strips. Switched grid from 24 cols to 36 cols so 1/2/3 inner-row players all divide cleanly with 6-col (~16.7%) sides. 7-/8-player layouts now have full-height sides; 3/5/6-player layouts now reliably show their right/left endcap player. Middle row is never used for cells now (TC remains floating). Existing games with stored positions still render correctly under the new logic without re-clearing — **committed**
- v3.14.7: Tall side seats + floating turn-counter overlay — `buildDynamicGrid()` upgraded from a 6-col to a 24-col template; right/left endcap players (p4/p8) now span ALL active rows as narrow ~17%-wide vertical strips when there's no edge-cell conflict (no p3/p5 for tall p4, no p1/p7 for tall p8); when a side is "short" (8-player layout) it stays in the middle row only. The `slot-center` is no longer a grid cell — it's a fixed-position floating overlay (`position: fixed; top:50%; left:50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%)`) so the turn counter doesn't consume a quadrant. Middle row is omitted from `gridTemplateRows` entirely when no short side player needs it, freeing the freed vertical space for top/bottom players. 5-player default position map now `['p1','p2','p4','p6','p7']` (Seat 5 at bot-left so p4 can be tall on the right). 6-player default now `['p1','p2','p4','p6','p7','p8']` (both sides tall). All button backgrounds (`.tc-life-btn`, `.tc-cpill-btn`, `.tc-elim-btn`, `.tc-ctr-btn`, `.turn-next-btn`) now solid `#000` for contrast against the colored playmat. `.tracker-card` padding bumped from `0.75rem 1rem` to `1.25rem 1.5rem` so player labels and commander-damage rows sit further from the playmat edges — **committed**
- v3.14.6: Fix grid-area shorthand wiping out per-slot grid placement + uniform seat polish — `buildDynamicGrid()` was setting `slotEl.style.gridRow`/`gridColumn` and _then_ `slotEl.style.gridArea = ''`, but `gridArea` is the shorthand for both, so the trailing clear blanked the values just set; reordered to clear `gridArea` first in both the top/bottom-row loop and `setSlot()` (the TC `placeTc()` already had this order, which is why TC was the only slot that worked). Also: removed `flex-direction: row-reverse` from `.tc-header` for 180°/90° rotations so the elim/revive button stays at every player's top-right (kept on `.tc-life-section`/`.tc-life-btn-col` since those reverses keep + buttons on consistent sides per POV). Card backgrounds now use a stronger player-color tint (radial gradient at 38% center fading to a 20% player-color base instead of plain `#13180f`) so seats are easily identifiable from across the table — **committed**
- v3.14.5: Fix default seat positions — old `SEAT_POSITIONS`/`DEFAULT_POSITIONS` for 4–7 players used endcaps (`p4`/`p8`) which forced rotated side seats and left the middle row half-empty; new defaults seat players along the long sides (4 = `['p1','p2','p6','p5']`, 6 = `['p1','p2','p3','p7','p6','p5']`, etc.) so the top/bottom rows fill evenly and rotations stay at 0°/180°; updated in both `game_detail.html` (live tracker) and `game_new.html` (creation defaults). Existing games keep their stored `grid_position`; clear via `UPDATE game_seats SET grid_position = NULL WHERE game_id = N;` to apply new defaults — **committed**
- v3.14.4: Fix tc slot auto-placement bug — removed `style="grid-area:tc"` from center slot HTML (named area "tc" didn't exist in dynamic grid, causing auto-placement after player slots = turn counter stranded at bottom of screen); added `placeTc()` helper that always clears `gridArea` before assigning `gridRow`/`gridColumn` — **committed**
- v3.14.3: Game tracker layout polish — tracker grid cleared from topbar/histbar (`top: 42px; bottom: 38px`); commander damage scrollable within card (`overflow-y: auto`); P/E pills with inline ☣/⚡ label + −/+ buttons; pill row constrained to inner edges of life button columns via `.tc-life-center` wrapper; dynamic equal-size player mats via `buildDynamicGrid()` — 6-column grid, equal columns per seat, empty rows collapsed; portrait still uses 2-col auto-flow — **committed**
- v3.14.2: Game tracker fullscreen + portrait fix — launch overlay on active games with "⛶ Go Fullscreen" / "Continue without fullscreen" buttons (satisfies browser user-gesture requirement); `⛶/⊠` toggle button in topbar; `fullscreenchange` + `webkitfullscreenchange` listeners update button icon and re-run `applyLayout()`; fixed `isPortrait()` to use `window.matchMedia('(orientation: portrait)')` so JS matches CSS media query exactly; added `portraitMQ.addEventListener('change', applyLayout)` for reliable orientation-change detection — **shipped**
- v3.14.1: Portrait-mode responsive game tracker — `@media (orientation: portrait)` switches `.tracker-grid` to 2-column `grid-auto-flow` layout; JS `applyLayout()` replaces `initGrid` + `sizeRotatedCards` and re-runs on every resize, setting `gridArea='auto'` + `order` (clockwise sort) + `rotate=0` in portrait and restoring topology positions + rotations in landscape; empty placeholder cells hidden in portrait via `display:none`; portrait turn row (T{N} · player name · → button) added to topbar, hidden in landscape via CSS, synced by `render()` — **shipped**
