"""Decklist collection check + owned-count aggregation (v3.27.19).

Shared infrastructure for two consumers:

* the **decklist checker** at ``/decklist`` (paste a decklist, see what you
  own and where — wantlist matcher);
* the **count-sorted collection view** (the existing ``/collection`` page
  gains a ``sort=count`` option so all printings of a high-count name
  cluster together by total-owned).

Both consumers route through :func:`name_owned_counts` for the
name-level total. The aggregation is the single ``GROUP BY`` query the
v3.27.10 spec required — see :func:`name_owned_counts` for the
performance contract (single indexed aggregate per page load; no
materialized counts column; no caching).

Request-path network invariant: **nothing here calls Scryfall**. The
checker matches against local data only — a name that does not resolve
becomes a Missing result, never a live fetch. The v3.23.x import-outage
lesson stays enforced.

    Each entry input shape (from :func:`parse_decklist_text`):
        ``{"name", "quantity", "is_basic", "line_numbers"}``

    Output entry shape (each bucket is a list of these):
        ``{"name", "wanted", "owned", "is_basic", "printings": [...]}``

    Bucketing rules:
        * basics → ``"basics"`` regardless of owned vs wanted (do not
          fold "do you have 10 Forests" into Have/Partial — the
          v3.27.19 spec calls this out explicitly);
        * non-basic, ``owned >= wanted`` → ``"have"``;
        * non-basic, ``0 < owned < wanted`` → ``"partial"``;
        * non-basic, ``owned == 0`` → ``"missing"``.

    Within Have / Partial each entry carries the per-printing detail
    rows (sorted tradeable-first by :func:`owned_inventory_for_names`)
    so the template can render "you have these printings, in these
    locations".
